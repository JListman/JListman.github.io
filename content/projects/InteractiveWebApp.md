I created this [interactive web app](https://jennylistman.shinyapps.io/WomenCandidates/) with data scraped from [CAWP](http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu). They research women's participation in politics maintain [a list](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/buzz-2018-potential-women-candidates-us-congress-and-statewide-elected-executive) of women running for US Congress and State offices.

I wrote code to scrape and combine data from their lists, create new variables, and visualize the data in an interactive map and searchable data table.

See the app in action [here](https://jennylistman.shinyapps.io/WomenCandidates/) and read a blog post about it [here](https://medium.com/@jblistman/an-app-to-search-for-women-running-for-office-in-2018-346f5a013ec9).
