This project was created with data scraped from the website of the [Center for American Women in Politics](http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu). The Center conducts research on women's participation in politics in America and maintains [a list](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/buzz-2018-potential-women-candidates-us-congress-and-statewide-elected-executive) of women who are or potentially will be running for US Congress and State offices.

I wrote code to scrape and combine data from their lists of women candidates, create new variables, and visualize the data in an interactive map and searchable data table.

See the app in action [here](https://jennylistman.shinyapps.io/WomenCandidates/) and read a blog post about it [here](https://medium.com/@jblistman/an-app-to-search-for-women-running-for-office-in-2018-346f5a013ec9).
