### I can help your nonprofit or small business:

* Get your data into a useable format and find data that you might not know you have.
* Analyze, summarize, & visualize your data to provide insight to you or your potential investors, clients, or donors.
* Tell your story with data.
* Analyse data through clustering, decision trees, and other machine learning tools.

### I have interdisciplinary training:

* B.A. in Biology, University of Pennsylvania in 1991
* PhD in Anthropological Genetics, New York University in 2009
* Postdoc at Yale University School of Medicine, Psychiatric Genetics in 2011 

I'm experienced in data wrangling, big data, machine learning, clustering, and data visualization. I'm skilled in communicating complex scientific and statistical concepts or results to colleagues and lay audiences via grants, blogging, project summaries or reports, public talks, and [research publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LEbo8lAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I was most recently Assistant Director, Program Development and Evaluation at NYU's [Center for K12 STEM Education](http://engineering.nyu.edu/k12stem) where I conducted and published quantitative assessments and outcomes evaluations of K-12 teacher PD and student programs.

Before that, I used genomic data to research human evolutionary and migratory history, a.k.a ancestry genomics. I collected saliva samples as a DNA source from over 500 individuals in rural Thailand to create a DNA resource of six ethnic populations. I also conducted research on the evolutionary history of genes involved in alcohol metabolism and substance abuse.
