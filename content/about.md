### I can help your nonprofit or small business:

* Get your data into a useable format and find data that you might not know you have.
* Analyze, summarize, & visualize your data to provide insight to you or your potential investors, clients, or donors.
* Tell your story with data.
* Analyse data through clustering, decision trees, and other machine learning tools.

I'm an interdisciplinary data scientist experienced in data wrangling, big data, machine learning, clustering, and data visualization. I received my B.A. in Biology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1991 and my PhD in Anthropological Genetics from New York University in 2009 followed by postdoctoral studies in Yale University School of Medicine's Psychiatric Genetics department. I'm skilled in communicating complex scientific and statistical concepts or results to colleagues and lay audiences via grants, blogging, project summaries or reports, public talks, and scientific publications.

I was most recently the Assistant Director, Program Development and Evaluation, Center for K12 STEM Education, NYU Tandon School of Engineering where I conducted and published quantitative assessments and outcomes evaluations of K-12 teacher PD and student programs for research, stewardship, and development.   
Using genomic data, I researched human evolutionary and migratory history in South East Asian populations and Jewish populations and carried out collection of saliva samples as a DNA source from over 500 individuals in rural Thailand, to create a DNA resource of six ethnic populations. 
While Associate Research Scientist at Yale University School of Medicine, she continued her work on human population genomic substructure and conducted research on the evolutionary history of genes involved in alcohol metabolism and substance abuse. She has been awarded multiple research grants from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.
