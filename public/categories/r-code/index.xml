      <description>This project uses a Recursive Partitioning And Regression Tree analysis from the rpart package to examine the effect of 49 gun law subcategories on annual State firearm death rates. Ten subcategories were found to significantly predict State gun death rate decreases or increases.  Read the blog post about it here and see the readme file for the infographic. Load packages

      <description>Interactive App To Visualize Women Runnning for State or Federal Offices This project was created with data scraped from the website of the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. The Center conducts research on womenâ€™s participation in politics in America and maintains a list of women who are or potentially will be running for US Congress and State offices.
The code scrapes and combines data from their lists of women candidates, cleans and creates new variables, and visualizes the data in an interactive shiny map and searchable data table using plotly and DT packages .</description>
