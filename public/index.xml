      <description>I created this interactive web app with data scraped from CAWP. They research women&amp;rsquo;s participation in politics maintain a list of women running for US Congress and State offices.
I wrote code to scrape and combine data from their lists, create new variables, and visualize the data in an interactive map and searchable data table.
See the app in action here and read a blog post about it here.</description>

      <description>This project uses a Recursive Partitioning And Regression Tree analysis from the rpart package to examine the effect of 49 gun law subcategories on annual State firearm death rates. Ten subcategories were found to significantly predict State gun death rate decreases or increases.  Data files needed to run this code can be found in my GitHub repo associated with the project.Read the blog post about it here and see the readme file for the infographic.</description>

      <description>Interactive App To Visualize Women Runnning for State or Federal Offices This project was created with data scraped from the website of the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. The Center conducts research on womenâ€™s participation in politics in America and maintains a list of women who are or potentially will be running for US Congress and State offices.
The code scrapes and combines data from their lists of women candidates, cleans and creates new variables, and visualizes the data in an interactive shiny map and searchable data table using plotly and DT packages .</description>
