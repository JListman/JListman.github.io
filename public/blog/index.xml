      <description>This project uses a Recursive Partitioning And Regression Tree analysis from the rpart package to examine the effect of 49 gun law subcategories on annual State firearm death rates. Ten subcategories were found to significantly predict State gun death rate decreases or increases. Data files needed to run this code can be found in my GitHub repo associated with the project.Read the blog post about it here.  Load packages</description>

      <description>New York City maintains an open data portal making data from many City agencies publicly available. If you’re looking for a good dataset to use for practicing data manipulation, analysis, or visualization techniques, it is a gold mine. NYC’s 311 system takes calls or online complaints and questions about any non-emergency matter, all of which are available on the NYC Open Data website. NYC 311 has a rodent sighting category and rat sub-category, which I used for this project.</description>

      <description>Interactive App To Visualize Women Runnning for State or Federal Offices This project was created with data scraped from the website of the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. The Center conducts research on women’s participation in politics in America and maintains a list of women who are or potentially will be running for US Congress and State offices.
The code scrapes and combines data from their lists of women candidates, cleans and creates new variables, and visualizes the data in an interactive shiny map and searchable data table using plotly and DT packages .</description>
